/*Create a function called greet
This function should accept 2 parameters (greeting, name)
The function should return a string with a greeting. 
For example if you give the function the arguments "Good morning" and "Paul" it will return the string "Good Morning Paul"
Console.log and call the function.*/


// TATYANAs SOLUTION

let greeting = (greet, name) => { // console.log(`${greet} ${name} `);
    return `${greet}  ${name}`
}
let g = greeting("Good morning ", "Paul");
console.log(g)

// SOLUTION:

function greet(greeting, name) {
    return `${greeting} ${name}`
};

console.log(greet("Good Morning", "Paul"));

// THIS ONE SHOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME ANY TROUBLE - NEED TO REVIEW FUNCTIONS AGAIN!!!!!


/* CHALLENGE 2
Create some code that counts from 0 to 100. 
Create some code that tests if the number is divisible by 3, 5, or 3 & 5.
If it is divisible by 3 print "Fizz"
If it is divisible by 5 print "Buzz"
If it is divisible by 3 & 5 print "FizzBuzz"
If the number is not divisible by any of these, print the number itself.
